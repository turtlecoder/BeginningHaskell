# Client Server Implementation of Cloud Haskell Tutorial

This is an implementation of the Math Server as implemented in Chapter 4 of the tutorial on Cloud Haskell [here](http://haskell-distributed.github.io/tutorials/4ch.html). This example is also implemented used in the book "Practical Concurrent Haskell: With Big Data Applications". (Apress)

To Run the example 
```
$ stack build # Build the example 
$ {{path-to-server}}/server & {{path-to-client}}/client

```

I've avoided any complications, but you could enhance the example by adding command line arguments.

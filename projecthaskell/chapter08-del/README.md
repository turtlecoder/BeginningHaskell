# Chapter 8 Notes

- Excercise 8-1: Parallel K-Means implementation, based on Chapter 6 code.
  Not the best implementation. It may not even run, need some better text 
  fixtures to test the code. 
  - [ ] _Add Link here in ParallelizingApriori.hs_
  
- Software Transactional Memory
  - Concurrent Usage of Resources
  - Concurrency-related code is side-effect
  - concurrent code is impure
    - order determines output, 
	- if pure, tehen all ordering will have same result. 
	
- Excercise 8-2: Implement a function for use with STM
 - [ ] _Add Link here RollingBackTransactions.hs
 
 - Excercise 8-3: Queuing Travellers
